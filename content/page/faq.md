## How do you define open science infrastructure? 

Open Science combines various movements and practices aiming to make multilingual science knowledge openly available. Open science infrastructure encompasses softwares, standards, protocols, services, platforms that allow scholarly stakeholders to practise, develop and observe open science.

## Is the project focussed on open science infrastructure for publication in particular (open access)?

No, TSOSI aims to include all infrastructures that support open science. We can think of the three main scientific outputs: software, data and publication; TSOSI aims to include infrastructure that helps make these artefacts openly available.

## How would you define if an infrastructure can join or not the project? 

A list of criteria is currently (2024-10) being defined. It will help in the decision-making process when it comes to integrating an infrastructure. To set the criteria we will start with the one from SCOSS (see the 2024 Expression of Interest and the FAQ).

## Is the project focussed on French open science infrastructure? 

No. The funder, for the launching year, is the French Committee for Open Science, but TSOSI has an international scope.

## Does the project exclude infrastructures that commercialise services?

No. Infrastructure can sell services, but should not sell data: “data related to the running of the scholarly infrastructure should be community property. Appropriate revenue sources might include value-added services, consulting, API Service Level Agreements or membership fees” (cf. The Principles of Open Scholarly Infrastructure)


## Is the project solely dedicated to large-scale open science infrastructure?
No, we also include smaller infrastructures, such as publishing platforms at national or regional level. For example [PeerCommunityIn](https://peercommunityin.org/) and [SciPost](https://scipost.org) are partners of the project.

On April 29, 2025 a webinar was held for the 'SCOSS family' â€” the infrastructures that have been selected by SCOSS (see [the SCOSS family on scoss.org](https://scoss.org/what-is-scoss/scossfamily/)). 

The agenda was as follows:


> Introduction, Vanessa Proudman
TSOSI story, ideas and goals, Maxence Larrieu <br />
TSOSI platform, how does it work?, Guillaume Alzieu <br />
TSOSI benetifs for SciPost, Jean-Sebastien Caux <br />
TSOSI benefits for DOAJ, Joanna Ball <br />


The discussion was insightful, and the key points will be added to this blogpost during May.

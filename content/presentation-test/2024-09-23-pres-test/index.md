## Background
(i)

----

The research relies on open infrastructures that are recent (< 30 years). The financing of these infrastructures is not stabilized and is a crucial issue. 

----

The actors of the research ecosystem must invent ways to support it.


"Governments, funders and  relevant  institutions are encouraged to: Commit  to  providing  the  funding  required  to  operationalize open science"

"by increasing funding for open science infrastructures and services"

UNESCO, 2022, [Funding open science](https://unesdoc.unesco.org/notice?id=p%3A%3Ausmarcdef_0000383709&posInSet=6&queryId=N-EXPLORE-8e161eb1-7b01-4506-b255-ba7d6a7f5780)

----
### Specificity of the open infrastructures

<br/>
they are financed without getting anything personalized in return, we pay for the support of a common good

### Key stakeholder

* **Open Infrastructures** : initiatives/organisations/services which contribute to open science (content & metadatas) on the web (DataCite, PKP, OpenCitation ...) [1]

* **Research Institutions** : institutions where the research takes place

----

[1] A rational on the perimeter and the naming will be necessary : 

* "Open scholarly infrastructure" ([POSI](https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/faq/))
* "Open infrastructure" ([SCOSS](https://scoss.org/what-is-scoss/defining-open-infrastructure/), [IOI](https://investinopen.org/about/))
* "Open research infrastructures"
* "Open science infrastructures" (SparcEurope, UNESCO)

## Limits
(iii)

----

* Funds are poorly valued, sometimes actors simply forget

* The visibility of funds depends on the websites of the actors

* Crucial data is missing : time, amount and PIDs (persistent identifiers)

----

The funds are displayed by HTML and logos information.

TSOI goal is to represent them with open and structured data (**ROR**, **wikidata**) in a dedicated and interoperable tool


----

> "The way we fund and resource open projects we rely on is insufficient" 

[Invest In Open](https://investinopen.org/about/)

<br />
<br />

----

Funding for open infrastructures is not visible globally

* lack of transparency
* lack of coordination
* the big picture isn't possible


---

## Towards a solution
(iv)

----

We aim to **valorize** the funding.

The more we value these funding the more common they will become. 

----
### How to valorize ? 

<br /> <br />
* In making **publicly available** the funding made from Research institution to open infrastructures 

* We **mimic**: if they do it we should do it
----

### TSOI, an added value for funding

<br /> <br />
Add value on funding, so that others will want to fund


----
### draft : we are in a transition


* from acquiring to funding
* buy ≠ fund
* we have been used to hiding the price of acquisitions (hiden subscription contrats )
* TSOI will promote funding for the Open Infra.

## Comparison
(v)

----

OpenAPC : open the cost of APCs

 (`"authors" ⟷ publishers`)


<br /><br />
TSOI : open the funding of the open infrastructures

(`institutions ⟷ open infrastructures`)

A la lumière des efforts effectués pour ouvrir les coûts impliqués par le système éditorial traditionnel, on devine l'importance, les enjeux, liés à l'ouverture des financements effectués pour les infrastructures ouverte.

## TSOI as a service
(vi)

----

### For research institutions

* TSOI adds value to your institution by making all your funds openly available: "no more manual updates on your website"

* Compare, understand where your peers are investing

----

### For open infrastructures

* Forget tables, logos and name changes: "focus on your service, we showcase your funders"
* Improve transparency (POSI)

* Compare, understand other economic models

----

### For the community & society

* An answer to the famous question "who pays ?" (OA is free myth)
* Explore the diversity of economic models
* Explore the tendancy of funding
